## Description
It is my final map for Company of Heroes 2<br/>

Huge 8 player urban map. Due it's size, the map might crash on slower PCs, in this case it is recommended to play with fewer players/bots and/or lower the graphics in the game options. The map is currently at the beta stage which means that this map is not finished yet and it will be updated from time to time.

<b>Recommended to play with mods which increase the popcap and adjust the zoom. </b>

<b>Known bugs: possible crashes </b>

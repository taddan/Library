## Description
Winter of 1944 has come. Allied forces launch an attack to capture Otterburg castle, an important German HQ on the bank of Saar river. To achieve this objective, Allied forces have to take Turdorf town which lies on the other bank of the river. Turdorf is a small town consisting of narrow alleys and densely built buildings. In the central part of the town lies radio tower and a fuel depot which is vital to support German tanks. Entrances to radio tower and fuel depot has been barricaded by Germans to prevent Allies from capturing them. The only way to get in is either to destroy these barricades or to try getting in through houses. Luckily for Germans, Allied forces will also have to count on their infantry as their armored divisions are quite far away to support them in the fight for Turdorf.

The map is more infantry based as there is only one fuel point which is locked up by closed gates in the middle of the map. To reach the fuel point, one needs to destroy at least one of the gates with vehicle, explosives and etc. There are also a lot of small passages which give big advantage for infantry.

## Description
Otterburg lies on the bank of Saar river in famous Siegfried Line. The Battle of Bulge has ended and Allied forces move deeper into the German territories. Today Allied forces have entered Turdorf, the backyard of Otterburg, and are ready to launch an attack on heavily guarded Otterburg castle.

Both Otterburg castle and Turdorf town are complex and confusing environment full of blind alleys, narrow crossings and etc. For armored vehicles it is a hard place to maneuver and for infantry it provides many opportunities for assaults and getaways. However, the outskirts around the castle and town are open, wide and excellent for armored combat.

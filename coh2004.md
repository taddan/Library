## Description
It is June 22, 1941. The Third Reich launches Operation Barbarossa. German troops are crossing the Soviet border. This attack brings a turmoil and confusion to the authorities of USSR. It has paralysed Soviet command and control leaving Soviet forces unorganized, fleeing and leaving their equipment behind.

In Volhynia, thirty kilometers behind the German-Soviet border, stands a railway junction which supports local industries. Before the German invasion, it was used for transporting Soviet military personel and equipment. Today, lots of military equipment is left in this junction, however it will not be so easy for German forces to capture this asset as Soviets have managed to get organized here and prepare to resist.
